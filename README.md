# Hey there!
I'm Adrian, a third-year software engineering student from Canada.
## About Me
I’m passionate about **full-stack development** and love working on projects that bring ideas to life.  
I’m also deeply interested in **cloud technologies, AI, and machine learning**, and I enjoy exploring how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.  
Always curious and eager to learn, I’m constantly building, experimenting, and growing my skillset.
