# Hey there!
I'm Adrian, a third-year software engineering student from Canada.
## About Me
I’m passionate about **full-stack development** and love working on projects that bring ideas to life.  
I’m deeply interested in **cloud technologies, AI, and machine learning**, and I enjoy exploring how they can be integrated with embedded systems to solve real-world problems.
